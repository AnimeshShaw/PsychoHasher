        <h2>PsychoHasher</h2>        
        <p>A Java based tool to generate and verify hashes for text, files, drives. It's a program which can compute the following 
            hashes: MD5, SHA1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512.</p>
        <p>    
            It can compute hashes for text string, individual files, no. of files, single hash for group of files. It also provides limited
            customization for the user to this application. After hash computation the user has the option to export the results as 
            a TSV (Tab-Separated) file.            
        </p>
        <h2>Current Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Compute hash value of text string.</li>
            <li>Compute hash value of individual files or files in a folder.</li>
            <li>Compute Single hash for group of files or folder.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>ToDo</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Add an option to compute hash for logical volumes.</li>
            <li>Add Verify hashes section.</li>
        </ul>
